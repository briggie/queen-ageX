# queen-ageX
Hello coders!
My name is bridget bobadoye and im creating queen-ageX which can be used by bee researchers, beekeepers and honeybee enthusiats. This is a software package for estimating the reproductive age of the queen bee as the hive goes through different developmental stages. This software can be readily integrated into already existing tools and methods for automated estimators of the queen bee age inorder to further augment its output.  
I combine neural network classification with graphical representation of physiological data to determine the reproductive age of the queen bee.
